19862;2;M;Section start: "Operation"
19862;4;N;This UART core is very similar in operation to the standard 16550 UART chip with the main exception being that only the FIFO mode is supported.
20006;4;N;The scratch register is removed, as it serves no purpose.
20064;4;N;This core can operate in 8-bit data bus mode or in 32-bit bus mode, which is now the default mode.
20163;4;N;The 32-bit mode is fully WISHBONE compatible and it uses the WISHBONE [SEL_I] signal to properly receive and return 8-bit data on 32-bit data bus.
20310;4;N;The 8-bit version might have problems in various WISHBONE implementations because a 32-bit master reading from 8-bit bus can expect data on different bytes of the 4-byte word, depending on the register address.
20521;4;N;Also, in 32-bit data bus mode, the [ADR_I] is 5 and not 3 bits wide.
20590;4;N;In addition, in the 32-bit data bus mode a debug interface is present in the system.
20675;4;N;This interface has 2 32-bit registers that can be read to provide non-intrusive look into the core’s registers and other internal values of importance.
20827;4;N;The selection between 32- and 8-bits data bus modes is performed by defining DATA_BUS_WIDTH_8 in uart_defines.v, uart_top.v or on the compiler/synthesizer tool command line.

21395;3;M;List Start
21395;4;N;Set the Line Control Register to the desired line control parameters.
21465;4;N;Set bit 7 to ‘1’ to allow access to the Divisor Latches.

21522;3;M;List Start
21522;4;N;Set the Divisor Latches, MSB first, LSB next.
21568;4;N;Set bit 7 of LCR to ‘0’ to disable access to Divisor Latches.
21630;4;N;At this time the transmission engine starts working and data can be sent and received.
21717;4;N;Set the FIFO trigger level.
21745;4;N;Generally, higher trigger level values produce less interrupt to the system, so setting it to 14 bytes is recommended if the system responds fast enough.
21899;4;N;Enable desired interrupts by setting appropriate bits in the Interrupt Enable register.
21987;0;M;List End
21987;4;N;Remember that (Input Clock Speed)/(Divisor Latch value) = 16 x the communication baud rate.
22079;4;N;Since the protocol is asynchronous and the sampling of the bits is performed in the perceived middle of the bit time, it is highly immune to small differences in the clocks of the sending and receiving sides, yet no such assumption should be made when calculating the Divisor Latch values.
