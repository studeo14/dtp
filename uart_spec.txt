17430::M::Table End: "4.8 Modem Status Register (MSR)"
17430::N::The divisor latches can be accessed by setting the 7th bit of LCR to ‘1’.
17504::N::You should restore this bit to ‘0’ after setting the divisor latches in order to restore access to the other registers that occupy the same addresses.
17655::N::The 2 bytes form one 16-bit register, which is internally accessed as a single number.
17742::N::You should therefore set all 2 bytes of the register to ensure normal operation.
17823::N::The register is set to the default value of 0 on reset, which disables all serial I/O operations in order to ensure explicit setup of the register in the software.
17987::N::The value set should be equal to (system clock speed) / (16 x desired baud rate).
18069::N::The internal counter starts to work when the LSB of DL is written, so when setting the divisor, write the MSB first and the LSB last.
18203::N::This register is only available when the core has 32-bit data bus and 5-bit address bus.
18292::N::It is read only and is provided for debugging purposes of chip testing as it is not part of the original UART16550 device specifications.
18430::N::Reading from the does not influence core’s bahaviour.
18484::M::Table Start: "4.10 Debug 1"
18484::N::When Bit # is 7-0, then Access is R.
18521::N::The Bit # 7-0 is Line Status Register value.
18566::N::When Bit # is 11-8, then Access is R.
18604::N::The Bit # 11-8 is Interrupt Enable Register value (bits 3-0).
18666::N::When Bit # is 15-12, then Access is R.
18705::N::The Bit # 15-12 is Interrupt Identifier Register value (bits 3-0).
18772::N::When Bit # is 23-16, then Access is R.
18811::N::The Bit # 23-16 is Line Control Register value.
18859::N::When Bit # is 31-24, then Access is R.
18898::N::The Bit # 31-24 is Modem Status Register value.
18946::M::Table End: "4.10 Debug 1"
18946::N::This register is only available when the core has 32-bit data bus and 5-bit address bus.
19035::N::It is read only and is provided for debugging purposes of chip testing as it is not part of the original UART16550 device specifications.
19173::N::Reading from the does not influence core’s bahaviour.
19227::M::Table Start: "4.11 Debug 2"
19227::N::When Bit # is 2-0, then Access is R.
19264::N::The Bit # 2-0 is Transmitter FSM state.
19304::N::When Bit # is 7-3, then Access is R.
19341::N::The Bit # 7-3 is Number of characters in Transmitter FIFO (tf_count).
19411::N::When Bit # is 11-8, then Access is R.
19449::N::The Bit # 11-8 is Receiver FSM state.
19487::N::When Bit # is 16-12, then Access is R.

19634::N::The Bit # 18-17 is Modem Control Register value (bits 4-0).
19694::N::When Bit # is 23-19, then Access is R.
19733::N::The Bit # 23-19 is FIFO Control Register value (bits 7-6).
19792::N::When Bit # is 31-24, then Access is R.
19831::N::Reserved.
19841::N::Returned value is 0.
19862::M::Table End: "4.11 Debug 2"
19862::N::This UART core is very similar in operation to the standard 16550 UART chip with the main exception being that only the FIFO mode is supported.
20006::N::The scratch register is removed, as it serves no purpose.
20064::N::This core can operate in 8-bit data bus mode or in 32-bit bus mode, which is now the default mode.
20163::N::The 32-bit mode is fully WISHBONE compatible and it uses the WISHBONE [SEL_I] signal to properly receive and return 8-bit data on 32-bit data bus.
20310::N::The 8-bit version might have problems in various WISHBONE implementations because a 32-bit master reading from 8-bit bus can expect data on different bytes of the 4-byte word, depending on the register address.
20521::N::Also, in 32-bit data bus mode, the [ADR_I] is 5 and not 3 bits wide.
20590::N::In addition, in the 32-bit data bus mode a debug interface is present in the system.
20675::N::This interface has 2 32-bit registers that can be read to provide non-intrusive look into the core’s registers and other internal values of importance.
20827::N::The selection between 32- and 8-bits data bus modes is performed by defining DATA_BUS_WIDTH_8 in uart_defines.v, uart_top.v or on the compiler/synthesizer tool command line.
21001::N::Upon reset the core performs the following tasks:
21051::M::List Start
21051::N::The receiver and transmitter FIFOs are cleared. 
21099::N::The receiver and transmitter shift registers are cleared 
21156::N::The Divisor Latch register is set to 0. 
21196::N::The Line Control Register is set to communication of 8 bits of data, no parity, 1 stop bit. 
21288::N::All interrupts are disabled in the Interrupt Enable Register. 
21350::M::List End
21350::N::For proper operation, perform the following:
21395::M::List Start
21395::N::Set the Line Control Register to the desired line control parameters. Set bit 7 to ‘1’ to allow access to the Divisor Latches. 
21522::M::List End
21522::M::List Start
21522::N::Set the Divisor Latches, MSB first, LSB next. 
21568::N::Set bit 7 of LCR to ‘0’ to disable access to Divisor Latches. At this time the transmission engine starts working and data can be sent and received. 
21717::N::Set the FIFO trigger level. Generally, higher trigger level values produce less interrupt to the system, so setting it to 14 bytes is recommended if the system responds fast enough. 
21899::N::Enable desired interrupts by setting appropriate bits in the Interrupt Enable register. 
21987::M::List End
21987::N::Remember that (Input Clock Speed)/(Divisor Latch value) = 16 x the communication baud rate.
22079::N::Since the protocol is asynchronous and the sampling of the bits is performed in the perceived middle of the bit time, it is highly immune to small differences in the clocks of the sending and receiving sides, yet no such assumption should be made when calculating the Divisor Latch values.
22369::N::The core implements the WISNBONE SoC bus interface for communication with the system.
22455::N::It has an 8-bit data bus for compatibility reason.
22506::N::The core requires one interrupt.
22539::N::It requires 2 pads in the chip (serial in and serial out) and, optionally, another six modem control signals, which can otherwise be implemented using general purpose I/Os on the chip.
22724::N::The block diagram of the core is on the following page.
